BIM Revit autodesk- 3d modelling
Three separate files are including hand drawing of the modelling beam, main program file in format of ifc file, documentation of the 3d modelling. This was my first BIM project, in the next drawing, I hope that I will be more precise. ![Screenshot (16)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115006824/193865258-6fcd7d1b-de96-452f-9809-a78ce923c04d.png)
